# Planning of the application "Planet"

## What should the program do?
- calculate orbits of Earth and other planets
- be time-dependent
- analyse changes of orbit with time
- interaction between planets

## Possible milestones
0. MATLAB
1. Earth in circular orbit, 2D
2. Earth ecc in present time, 2D
3. Inner planets, 2D
4. Outer planets, 2D
5. Stability
6. 3D
7. Milankovitch (eccentricity)

## Programming
- pre functional in matlab
- modular in python
- functional?
- plots
- oo

## Analysis
- No input
- Initial values
  - position of planets
  - speed of planets
- physical constants and properties
  - G
  - M of sun and m of planets
  - time steps (uncertain)
- output
  - position
  - speed
  - (streamlines)
- functions
  - F=GMm/r2
  - F = mv2/r
  - F = ma
